🧠 HRB Jackpot Coin: Master Plan (vFinal)
🎯 Vision:
The first viral crypto designed for the masses — with provable fairness, jackpot excitement, and a wallet your grandma can use.

🔐 1. Ownership & Governance
Parent Brand: HRB Studios

Coin Name: HRB Jackpot Coin

Ticker: HRB

Rights: Open-source, community-governed with admin wallet protections

Official Website: hrbstudios.com (to host wallet downloads, updates, terms, etc.)

🪙 2. Tokenomics
Fixed Supply Cap: 25,000,000 HRB

Genesis Supply: 0 (no premine)

Initial Reward: 50 HRB/block

Reward Halving Interval: Every 210,000 blocks

Block Time Doubling Schedule: Every 210,000 blocks (i.e. every ~2 years)

📉 Halving & Timing Schedule
Phase	Years	Block Time	Block Reward	Golden Block	Diamond Block	Notes
Y0–2	0–2	1 min	50 HRB	100 HRB	250 HRB	Hypergrowth
Y2–4	2–4	2 min	25 HRB	50 HRB	125 HRB	Early community
Y4–6	4–6	4 min	12.5 HRB	25 HRB	62.5 HRB	Slowing emission
Y6–8	6–8	8 min	6.25 HRB	12.5 HRB	31.25 HRB	Final spacing
Y8+	8+	8 min	3.125 → ...	6.25 → ...	15.625 → ...	Halves every 210k blocks

✅ Golden = 2× base reward

✅ Diamond = 5× base reward

✅ Total estimated mining time: ~29.13 years

💰 3. Special Block Rewards
Golden Block: 2× current base reward

Diamond Block: 5× current base reward

Guaranteed fairness:

50/50 split between ASIC and CPU/GPU miners

If 3 jackpot wins go to one type, the next is forced to the other

🎰 4. Jackpot System
Jackpot Types:

Mini Jackpot: 50 HRB

Minor Jackpot: 100 HRB

Major Jackpot: 500 HRB

Grand Jackpot: 1000 HRB

Seeded by Owner:

Initial manual funding

Must repay owner +10% before triggering new win

Growth Logic:

Every transaction contributes to jackpot pools

Hardcoded fairness rules prevent gaming the system

Win triggers animated GUI popup and mobile alert

🖥️ 5. Wallet & Mining Design
🖥️ GUI Desktop Wallet:
1-click "Create Wallet"

1-click "Create Mining Wallet"

Device-type auto-detection (ASIC vs CPU) via hash rate

Mining panel: block height, status, progress bar

Jackpot popup animations

Auto desktop icon for easy access

📱 Mobile Companion App (Phase 2):
Real-time miner stats & alerts

Jackpot win notifications

Monthly subscription model

Only official app can link to mining wallet

🚫 6. Anti-Cheat Enforcement
✅ Phase 1: Soft Flag
Flags if device changes (e.g. CPU → ASIC)

Mining allowed, but disables special blocks

Cold wallet blocked

Logs flag for admin review

🚫 Phase 2: Hard Ban
If user persists, permanent ban triggers

Disables jackpot eligibility forever

Wallet funds returned to jackpot pool

No appeal process

🧪 Admin Tools
flagged_wallets.log auto-loads for admin users in GUI

Flagged wallets frozen from sending

GUI notification system for new flags

Admin-only buttons: Ban, Unban, Review logs

🔐 7. Long-Term Scarcity Strategy
Aggressive early release (~42% in first 2 years)

Slows to sustainable tail (halves every ~3.2 years after Y8)

8-minute blocks reduce chain bloat long-term

Jackpot odds scale down over time

Later rewards too small for ASIC dominance → favors hobbyist CPU mining again

🧠 8. Narrative & Virality Strategy
🎯 “Hope, Fun, and Instant Dopamine”

🕹️ Gamified mining

🎉 Viral jackpot win moments

👵 Passes “grandma test” (dead simple UX)

🐋 Pulls in whales by exciting the masses

🧵 Meme-worthy moments: “Powerball of Crypto”

🔜 9. Immediate Next Tasks
✅ Blockchain functional and compiling

✅ Full tokenomics locked in

🔨 Code GetBlockSubsidy(), Golden/Diamond scaling

🔨 Implement jackpot reward triggers in miner

🎨 Add GUI: jackpot popup animations + admin panel

📦 Build OS installers (auto desktop icon)

📱 Begin sketching mobile companion features

✅ Final HRB Secure Recovery: Locked Blueprint Summary
Core Concept:
No seed phrases. No ID. No selfies. No Google or Apple.
Just you — your 2FA, your biometrics, your encrypted vault.

Recovery Model:
➡️ Any 2 of 3 threshold key reconstruction using:

Share A: Device-Bound Biometric Share

Local only

Biometric-bound via Secure Enclave/TPM

Share B: 2FA TOTP Share

Encrypted by 2FA secret (e.g., Google Authenticator)

Stored on-chain or IPFS, publicly accessible but useless without 2FA

Share C: Optional Vault Backup

Encrypted with strong user passphrase

Exportable as QR code or USB file

🔒 What to Build (Technical To-Do)
✅ 1. Wallet Initialization Flow

Generate master private key

Derive recovery key

Split recovery key using Shamir (or MPC)

Encrypt:

Share A → Biometric key (TPM/Secure Enclave)

Share B → 2FA-derived key

Share C → passphrase-derived key

Store A on device, B on-chain/IPFS, C optionally exported

✅ 2. Recovery Flow

Prompt user for wallet address

Retrieve Share B

Request TOTP 2FA (to decrypt B)

Request biometric unlock (new device regenerates Share A)

If needed, decrypt Share C via passphrase

Reconstruct recovery key from any 2 shares

Unlock master wallet key

✅ 3. Security Library Integration
Use a proven crypto library:

slip39 for Shamir/Mnemonic-based sharing

libthresholdcryptography

sss for high-efficiency implementations

✅ 4. Biometrics Integration

Use Secure Enclave (iOS) / Keystore (Android) / TPM (Windows/Linux)

Biometric-bound keys must never leave the chip

On new device: generate fresh Share A via biometric challenge → local secret reconstruction

✅ 5. Blockchain/IPFS Storage

Store Share B on-chain:

Encrypted blob tied to wallet address

Can also use IPFS to decentralize

Never contains raw data — must be TOTP-decryptable

🧠 UX You MUST Nail
Step	UX Tip
Create Vault Backup	“Download a safety backup? If you ever lose your phone + 2FA, this can save your coins.”
Show Backup QR	Let user screenshot or print a recovery card
Test Recovery Flow	Offer simulated recovery test (bonus: gamify it)
Biometric Challenge	Keep it quick. “Just use your face/fingerprint to prove it’s really you.”
2FA Prompt	Let user scan a QR into Google Authenticator, HRB Authenticator, or Authy
Recovered? 🎉	Flash confetti. Literally. Instant trust-building.

🔁 Optional “Recovery Assistant” App
Let users check and verify:

Which shares are active

Run simulated recovery test

“Last verified on: [date]” badges

Bonus: Notify if 2FA sync drifts or if vault is untested too long

🛡️ Security Guarantees
✅ 100% self-custody
✅ No single point of failure
✅ Nothing lives in the cloud unprotected
✅ 2FA and biometrics never used as passwords, only key guards
✅ No one can steal your recovery unless they physically have your 2FA and match your biometrics
✅ Even HRB Studios can’t recover for you — and that’s the point.
