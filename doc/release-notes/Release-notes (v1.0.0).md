**HRB Jackpot Coin Core — Launch Release (v1.0.0)**
*A New Vision for Proof-of-Work: Mining for Everyone*

HRB Jackpot Coin is a revolutionary Proof-of-Work (PoW) cryptocurrency that transforms mining from a race of hashpower into a thrilling, fair, and rewarding experience for all. Launching with zero pre-mine, no ICO, and a fixed total supply, HRB is a pure-mineable cryptocurrency built by the people, for the people—empowering everyday users, not industrial farms.

## Core Vision & Problem Solved

HRB is a groundbreaking Proof-of-Work (PoW) cryptocurrency designed to democratize mining and create a dynamic, engaging, and self-sustaining economy. It directly addresses the centralization of mining power and the waning excitement in traditional PoW by integrating a unique, fair, and transparent "Slot Chain" jackpot system.

### Problems HRB Solves

* **Centralization of Mining**: Traditional PoW favors large, expensive ASIC/GPU farms, pushing out individual miners.
* **Declining Miner Engagement**: Mining becomes a predictable, low-margin business, losing its initial allure.
* **Lost Coin Supply**: Permanently lost coins reduce effective circulating supply and miner incentive.
* **Regulatory Ambiguity**: HRB aims for explosive growth while adhering to legal safety by separating utility from speculative investment.

## The HRB Ecosystem: Two Wallet Types

HRB introduces a critical distinction between wallet types to ensure fairness, security, and proper system function.

### Mining Wallet (MW) – The Active Workstation

* **Purpose**: Exclusively for mining operations, receiving standard block rewards, and eligibility for jackpot draws.
* **Nature**: Designed as a temporary holding area for recently mined HRB.
* **Device Linking**: One MW per entity/person/location/device, enforced via a privacy-preserving hardware fingerprint.
* **Declaration**: Users declare the MW as either a "Single Device Wallet" (SDW) or a "Multi-Device Wallet" (MDW).
* **Device Enforcement**: SDW can only link one CPU and submit CPU-verified shares. MDW can link multiple devices.
* **Eligibility**: Only MWs actively submitting valid shares within a recent time window (e.g., 10 minutes or 5 blocks) qualify for jackpots.
* **Self-Purging**: MWs inactive for 12 consecutive months are automatically terminated. Funds return to the mining pool.

### Regular Wallet (RW) – The Secure Vault

* **Purpose**: Long-term storage, sending/receiving transactions, DApps, cold storage, exchange operations, and future staking/governance.
* **Nature**: Permanent and secure; not eligible for mining or jackpot draws.
* **Transfer Requirement**: Users must move HRB from MW to RW for safekeeping.

## The "Slot Chain" Jackpot System (HRB's Core Innovation)

HRB's jackpot system turns mining into a gamified experience powered by network activity.

### Jackpot Tiers

* Mini Jackpot
* Minor Jackpot
* Major Jackpot
* Grand Jackpot

### Funding Sources

* **Founder Seed**: HRB Studios funds initial jackpot tiers.
* **Transaction Fees**: A small percentage of each transaction funds the jackpots.
* **Block Rewards**: A fraction (e.g., 0.05 HRB/block) ensures steady pool growth.

### Founder Reimbursement

* Founders are repaid the initial seed + 10% premium via transaction/mining fees.
* Once reimbursed, all fees go directly to jackpot pools.

### Randomized Draws

* **Trigger**: Jackpots are triggered randomly using a Verifiable Random Function (VRF).
* **Class Split**: VRF chooses either CPU or ASIC/GPU class with a 50/50 chance, ensuring balanced reward distribution.

## IV. Anti-Cheating & Integrity Measures

* Strict one-device-per-MW linking
* SDW enforcement: CPU-only, violations permanently banned
* MWs linked to cheating are permanently blacklisted
* Inactive MWs terminated and funds returned to pool
* Jackpot draws use decentralized VRF to prevent manipulation

---

## V. Economic & Market Strategy

* **Utility**: HRB fuels jackpot mining, DApps, governance, and micro-transactions.
* **Scarcity**: 25 million fixed cap, MW expiration, and halving schedule.
* **Demand**: Driven by excitement, fairness, and future utility.
* **Narrative**: "Mining for Everyone," "The Blockchain That Plays Fair," "Decentralized Slot Machine."
* **Launch Strategy**: Pure PoW, no premine, no ICO/IEO. Founders seed and step back.
* **Regulatory Approach**: Jackpots framed as participation-based bonuses—not gambling or investments.

---

## VI. Future Vision

* **HRB Privacy Chain**: Monero-like private version with jackpot incentives.
* **HRB Mobile Chain**: Mobile-optimized PoW chain with Web3 support.
* **Native DApps**: Games, NFT markets, and micro-service layers that reinforce jackpot economy.

---

## Technical Specifications

* **Total Supply**: 25,000,000 HRB
* **Launch Method**: 100% PoW mining, no premine, no ICO
* **Initial Block Reward**: 10 HRB
* **Block Time**: Starts at 1 minute, doubles each halving up to 8 minutes max
* **Reward Halving**: Begins only after reaching the 8-minute block time cap
* **Smallest Unit**: jackHRB (1 HRB = 100,000,000 jackHRB)
* **Halving Schedule**: Every 210,000 blocks, block time increases and special reward frequency reduces; reward halvings begin post-cap
